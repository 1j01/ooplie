# OOPLiE

### Object-Oriented Programming Language in English

Nothing yet.
[Except a nice little console.](http://1j01.github.io/ooplie/dooplie/)

"DOOPLIE" stands for "Dynamic OOPLiE-Oriented Programmatic Lingual Integrated Environment" or something.
That's a mouthful.

"OOPLiE", however, is not a bacronym.

### "Roadmap"

* Lots and lots of tests (that all fail)

* Try to implement something

* Usable for simple shell scripts (`#!/bin/english`!)

* More complex control flow

* Mathematics

* Modules (+extract shell script stuff and anything else)

* JavaScript interop (access node modules etc. and make English wrappers)

* Try to write a web app with this

* Internationalization (multiple language support)

* Integrated development environment

(with lots of rewriting along the way; nothing necessarily in that order; nothing *likely* to be in that order)
