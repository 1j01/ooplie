# OOPLiE

### Object-Oriented Programming Language in English

Nothing yet.
[Except a nice little console.][console]

"DOOPLIE" stands for "Dynamic OOPLiE-Oriented Programmatic Lingual Integrated Environment" or something.
That's a mouthful.

"OOPLiE", however, is not a bacronym.

### "Roadmap"

* Lots and lots of tests (that all fail)

* Try to implement something

* Usable for simple shell scripts (`#!/bin/english`!)

* More complex control flow

* Mathematics

* Module system (extract shell script stuff and anything else)

* JavaScript interop (access node modules etc. and make OOPLiE wrappers)

* Try to write a web app with this

* Internationalization (multiple language support)

* Integrated development environment
  * especially with "Did you mean?" style error handling that can update your actual code
  * but also hopefully with [Light Table][]-like live inspection features
  * and it could possibly blur the line between entering commands and writing a program

* Reusable syntax highlighting engine/module

* Gather feedback about how people would write programs in English

(with lots of rewriting along the way; nothing necessarily in that order; nothing *likely* to be in that order)
